# Exploratory-Data-Analysis – XYZ Analytics (Simulation Project) 
## 📌 Project Overview  
This project simulates a real-world **customer churn analysis** conducted for **XYZ Analytics**, focusing on identifying key churn drivers and delivering actionable business insights. The analysis demonstrates advanced data analytics, machine learning, and communication skills, from data exploration to executive-level reporting.  The objective is to analyze customer behavior, predict churn risk, and support informed decision-making through data-driven insights.  ---  
## 🎯 Project Objectives 
* Identify essential customer data influencing churn
* Design a structured and strategic investigation approach
* Analyze customer trends and patterns using Python
* Build and optimize a machine learning model for churn prediction
* Communicate findings through a concise executive summary  ---
## 🗂️ Dataset Summary 
The dataset contains customer-level information, including:  * **Customer Attributes**: Demographics and account details * **Usage Patterns**: Service subscriptions and engagement * **Billing Information**: Charges and payment behavior * **Target Variable**:    * `Churn' 
*This project is based on a simulated client dataset for analytical demonstration purposes.*  ---  
### 🔍 Methodology & Workflow 
### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Preparation  * Identified critical client data required for churn analysis * Cleaned and processed raw data using **Pandas** and **NumPy** * Handled missing values and optimized data types  
### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  * Analyzed churn distribution across customer segments * Explored relationships between churn and key features * Used visualizations to interpret trends and patterns  
### 3️⃣ Data Visualization  * Developed clear and insightful visualizations to support trend analysis * Highlighted key churn drivers using charts and plots  Libraries used:  * Matplotlib * Seaborn  
### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Model  * Engineered and optimized a **Random Forest Classifier** * Tuned model parameters to improve predictive performance * Achieved a **50% recall** in identifying customers likely to churn  
### 5️⃣ Executive Summary  * Produced a concise executive summary translating analytical results into **actionable business recommendations** * Focused on insights that support retention strategies and decision-making  ---  
## 📈 Key Insights (Highlights)  * Certain customer segments exhibit significantly higher churn risk * Usage patterns and billing behavior strongly influence churn probability * Machine learning can effectively identify at-risk customers for proactive retention  --- 
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
* **Programming Language**: Python  * **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy * **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn * **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
## Results  
* Successfully demonstrated an end-to-end churn analytics workflow
* Achieved **50% recall** in churn prediction using a Random Forest mode
* Delivered business-focused insights suitable for executive stakeholders  ---
## 🔮 Future Improvements  
* Improve recall through feature engineering and class imbalance handling
* Experiment with advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
* Add model explainability (SHAP, feature importance)
* Deploy the model as an API or dashboard  ---
