# Exploratory-Data-Analysis – XYZ Analytics (Simulation Project) 
## 📌 Project Overview  This project simulates a real-world **customer churn analysis** conducted for **XYZ Analytics**, focusing on identifying key churn drivers and delivering actionable business insights. The analysis demonstrates advanced data analytics, machine learning, and communication skills, from data exploration to executive-level reporting.  The objective is to analyze customer behavior, predict churn risk, and support informed decision-making through data-driven insights.  ---  ## 🎯 Project Objectives  * Identify essential customer data influencing churn * Design a structured and strategic investigation approach * Analyze customer trends and patterns using Python * Build and optimize a machine learning model for churn prediction * Communicate findings through a concise executive summary  ---  ## 🗂️ Dataset Summary  The dataset contains customer-level information, including:  * **Customer Attributes**: Demographics and account details * **Usage Patterns**: Service subscriptions and engagement * **Billing Information**: Charges and payment behavior * **Target Variable**:    * `Churn` (Yes / No)  > ⚠️ *This project is based on a simulated client dataset for analytical demonstration purposes.*  ---  ## 🔍 Methodology & Workflow  ### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Preparation  * Identified critical client data required for churn analysis * Cleaned and processed raw data using **Pandas** and **NumPy** * Handled missing values and optimized data types  ### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  * Analyzed churn distribution across customer segments * Explored relationships between churn and key features * Used visualizations to interpret trends and patterns  ### 3️⃣ Data Visualization  * Developed clear and insightful visualizations to support trend analysis * Highlighted key churn drivers using charts and plots  Libraries used:  * Matplotlib * Seaborn  ### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Model  * Engineered and optimized a **Random Forest Classifier** * Tuned model parameters to improve predictive performance * Achieved a **50% recall** in identifying customers likely to churn  ### 5️⃣ Executive Summary  * Produced a concise executive summary translating analytical results into **actionable business recommendations** * Focused on insights that support retention strategies and decision-making  ---  ## 📈 Key Insights (Highlights)  * Certain customer segments exhibit significantly higher churn risk * Usage patterns and billing behavior strongly influence churn probability * Machine learning can effectively identify at-risk customers for proactive retention  ---  ## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  * **Programming Language**: Python 🐍 * **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy * **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn * **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest) * **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  ---  ## 📁 Repository Structure  ``` ├── data/ │   └── churn_data.csv ├── notebooks/ │   └── customer_churn_analysis.ipynb ├── images/ │   └── visualizations.png ├── reports/ │   └── executive_summary.pdf ├── README.md ```  ---  ## 🚀 Results  * Successfully demonstrated an end-to-end churn analytics workflow * Achieved **50% recall** in churn prediction using a Random Forest model * Delivered business-focused insights suitable for executive stakeholders  ---  ## 🔮 Future Improvements  * Improve recall through feature engineering and class imbalance handling * Experiment with advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM) * Add model explainability (SHAP, feature importance) * Deploy the model as an API or dashboard  ---  ## 🤝 Contributing  Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome.  ---  ## 📜 License  This project is licensed under the MIT License.  ---  ⭐ *If you find this project useful, consider giving it a star!*
